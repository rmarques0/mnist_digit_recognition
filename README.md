### History of Handwritten Digit dataset 

Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database (MNIST dataset) is a large dataset of handwritten digits which is widely used in image processing and machine learning. The set of images in the MNIST database is a combination of two of NIST's databases: Special Database 1 and Special Database 3. Special Database 1 and Special Database 3 consist of digits written by high school students and employees of the United States Census Bureau, respectively.<br>

### Why to start with MNIST dataset?
The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset for image classification. Tensorflow and Keras also provide MNIST dataset directly through their APIs. For the learning purpose, the MNIST dataset is easy to use and experiment with different machine learning techniques.

### About the Notebook
* In this notebook, I have covered the necessary steps to approach any Machine Learning Classification Problem.
* Included Image Visualization for better understanding.
* Quick Links to the functions I have used to explore it in depth.
* Basic techniques such as Confusion Matrix, Image Augmentation, etc.
* I have also compared the results of Model without using CNN and CNN.

I have tried to make this notebook as simple as possible, along with covering the basic approach to tackle any classification task. 
### Task
The task is to classify the images in 10 class, i.e., [0-9], inclusively.
